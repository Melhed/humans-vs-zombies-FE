              The game begins with one or more “Original Zombies” (OZ)
              or patient zero. The purpose of the OZ is to infect
              human players by tagging them. Once tagged, a human
              becomes a zombie for the remainder of the game.
            </li>
            <li>
              Human players are able to defend themselves against the
              zombie horde using Nerf weapons and clean, rolled-up
              socks which may be thrown to stun an unsuspecting
              zombie.

              Many variants of the game rules exist which introduce
              additional rules and activities into the game; for
              example, the Rhodes University variant introduces a
              web-based game map where markers appear showing the
              location of missions and supplies. The appearance of
              supplies forces humans to leave their safe zones and
              risk being turned.
